
/*INPUT:- Ask user for digital data stream generation i.e., whether
user wants completely random sequence or a random sequence with
fixed sub-sequences (usually used for scrambling) and the type of
encoding. For encoding you need to provide user with various
options (NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI). If
user asks for AMI, you need to pop a query whether scrambling is
needed or not, if answer is yes next query would ask about the type
of scrambling.
